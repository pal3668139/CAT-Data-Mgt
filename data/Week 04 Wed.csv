Actually, you're all do a fantastic job!
Keep up the good work. ",,"Yes, I sent the form email to my two Representatives","Yes, I sent the form email to my Senator","These are both form letters, each of which sends to all 3 policy makers.

However, one is a House Bill (HB2126) and the other is a Senate Bill (SB6029) so sending to all 3 WA Government officials doesn't make sense.

Specifically... sending the first one to our Senator Liz Lovelett doesn't make sense, and neither does sending the second one to either of our Representatives - Alex Ramel and Debra Lekanoff.

Unfortunately, it doesn't appear that it can altered.

I realize Futurewise is a separate organization, but thought somebody might be able to inform someone at Futurewise of this issue.

Thanks,
