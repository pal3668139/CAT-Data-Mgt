Here is the longer letter I just crafted in case this is helpful for any future actions on this topic:

------
Dear Senators,

I oppose SB 5667 as it is currently drafted.  Please oppose the current bill and work on a better solution to address the issue.

Specifically, please do not increase the payment from 50 up to 90 percent unless you are also increasing the funding for the program overall.  Please listen seriously to the concerns of the Suquamish Tribe, namely that if the program is under-funded it will have harmful impacts on residents of the tribe and their lands.

In addition, please reconsider the 20-acre trigger in the proposed bill.  This change opens the door for harming water quality and reducing riparian buffers. 

Overall, I strongly believe that riparian buffers are critical for protecting our waterways and our salmon habitat, in addition to sequestering carbon, filtering water, and many other ecosystem benefits.  Any changes to this program should be considered through a climate and equity lens.  Please do not weaken our protection of forest lands and riparian areas.  Thanks for your consideration during this busy session.

SIGNED

I did a bit of research and came up with these comments based on the bill report, which themselves leave something lacking:

This bill would further weaken those protections in the following ways:
•	The provisions of the bill will likely degrade natural resources:
o	It’s unclear how the 20 acre exemption will work, and if over-applied (as seems likely given the significant boost in compensation), could lead to an unaccountable and unenforceable proliferation of alternative management plans, and the accompanying deterioration of riparian buffers, with a significant impact on water quality, particularly in smaller and more densely-developed watersheds.
o	The increased administrative load will drain capacity from the Department of Natural Resources, with relatively more benefit going to landowners and less to natural resources.
o	With significantly increased incentives, the program will incur much greater payouts, which will drain funds from the Natural Climate Solutions account, draining funds from programs with arguably greater climate impacts.
•	The bill contains a decrease in easement durations and an increase in percent compensation. If payment of 90 percent of the easement is required, the state should buy permanent easements with the public investment.",,"Yes, I sent the form email",,,,,,"Yes, I chose Pro and signed in",,,,,,

I rewrote them in my comment as follows: ""This bill needs improvement. First, Ecology has noted that effects on overburdened communities and vulnerable populations would depend on the final linkage agreement, which means community members do not have the details required to meaningfully provide input.  Second, Ecology has requested this legislation before having completed an environmental justice assessment. Third, Ecology proposes removing the existing 10,000 MT C02e per year threshold for reporting GHG emissions for electricity, which will eliminate information that is essential for determining local air quality impacts.  Fourth, linkage with California's market has the potential to flood Washington's market with banked California allowances.  Fifth, before entering into a linkage agreement, the state must evaluate and make a finding as to whether the aggregate number of unused allowances in a linked program would reduce the stringency of the state's program and the state's ability to meet its emissions limits.  Sixth, one of the stated reasons for linking with other jurisdictions is to drive down the cost of Washington's carbon allowances. This will result in decreased revenue to (1) mitigate the effects of the climate crisis on Washington's communities; (2) create and promote green, mass transportation infrastructure; and (3) build and support green energy infrastructure and jobs. "" I hope this is accurate.  Perhaps the bill tracker could rewrite these points. Thanks!  Also, I question whether we should be opposing the bill.",See above :) but thanks!
